# Python Tools

## Script 1:

This Python script combines multiple text files from a specified directory and removes duplicate lines. It uses the `os` module for file operations, `tqdm` for displaying a progress bar, and `colorama` for colored output.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- `tqdm` library (`pip install tqdm`)
- `colorama` library (`pip install colorama`)

## Usage

1. Clone or download the script from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/makerofdreams/life_easy_with_python/blob/main/Script%201-%20Combine%20txt%20Files%20%26%20Remove%20Dupl.%20Lines.py).
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is saved.
3. Run the script using the command `python Script 1- Combine txt Files & Remove Dupl. Lines.py`.
4. When prompted, enter the directory path where the text files are located.
5. The script will combine the files, remove duplicate lines, and save the output to a file named `combined.txt` in the same directory.
6. Progress will be displayed with a progress bar.
7. If any files encounter encoding errors, they will be skipped and a message will be displayed.
8. Once the process is complete, a success message will be shown.

Feel free to modify the script as needed to suit your requirements.

**Note:** Make sure to install the required dependencies (`tqdm`, `colorama`) before running the script.
